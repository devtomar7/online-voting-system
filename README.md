# online-voting-system
Developed a simulated Online Voting System using Python in Google Colab. The system supports voter registration, login authentication, candidate registration, secure vote casting, and real-time result visualization. It prevents duplicate voting and maintains vote integrity using a simple in-memory data structure.
